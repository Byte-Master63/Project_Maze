# Maze Game (Raycasting)

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Maze Game**! This project implements a **2D maze renderer** using the **raycasting technique** to simulate a first-person perspective of the maze. The game does not allow for interactive player movement in real-time, but the camera’s position and angle are customizable in the code. This project showcases the basic principles of **raycasting** and **SDL2** graphics rendering.

This project is a part of my personal development journey and showcases how raycasting works in a 3D-like environment on a 2D plane.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/Byte-Master63/Project_Maze

### Prerequisites

Before running the Maze Game, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **SDL2**: SDL2 is required for creating the window and rendering graphics.
  - Install it on **Ubuntu** using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    ```

- **GCC**: Ensure that GCC (4.8.4 or later) is installed to compile the source code.

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/maze-game.git
cd maze-game

#Usage
Maze Layout: The maze layout is represented as a 2D array in the code. Each value indicates whether the cell is a wall (1) or an empty space (0).

Camera Angle: The camera’s angle and the player’s position are defined in the code. Modify these values to change the starting point and camera perspective.

Map Customization: You can modify the map array in maze.h to design different mazes.
